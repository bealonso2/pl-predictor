## About
[pl-predictor](https://github.com/bealonso2/pl-predictor) is an ongoing project to try and predict the outcome of the Premier League more accurately than my friends.

I started in 2020 to try and improve my python skills and learn more about data science. While my python skills have improved, I have a long way to go with predicting the results of the Premier League.

## Results
Here is how I've done so far:

The dashed lines represent the 538 predictions, which I hold to be the gold standard. My goal is to beat them (in addition to my friends).
